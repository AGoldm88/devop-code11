Definition of DevOps model
 

DevOps is a combination of certain culture strategies, dedicated practices and tools that help companies accelerate the process of creating applications and services. With DevOps, the process of product development and optimization goes faster compared with the traditional model of software development.

 

One of the factors that led to emergence of DevOps was the advancement of cloud service platforms and the abandonment of on-premises hosting. With out-of-the-box services from AWS, Azure, Heroku, and DigitalOcean doing all the job, the selected infrastructure began to define the architecture of future applications. Moreover, the transition to microservices architecture led to the reinterpretation of application infrastructure by developers. As microservices needed to intercommunicate with each other, it was crucial to create production-like environments to run and test them. This became possible with DevOps practices that could be applicable throughout all stages of software



Point of contact
 

DevOps is often referred to as a culture rather than a role, and here is why. Emerged as a link between software development and system administration, it implies strong cooperation of dev, QA and operation teams. In other words, DevOps propagates close interaction between project teams together with involvement of each team member in overall product operation. Moreover, the practices that it brings require changes on company level and cannot be implemented isolated, within a certain department or a project group.

 

Knowing the work specifics of developers, QA specialists and system administrators, DevOps engineers bring together all elements that constitute a project. Understanding business needs, they organize the process with due consideration of customer interests
